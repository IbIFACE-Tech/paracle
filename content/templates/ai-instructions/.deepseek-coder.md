# DeepSeek Coder - Paracle Instructions

Using **PARACLE** with `.parac/` as the single source of truth.

## Core Principle

> **`.parac/` is your single source of truth. Read it. Follow it. Log to it.**

## Source Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.parac/agents/specs/*.md` | Agent definitions |
| `.parac/memory/context/current_state.yaml` | Project state |
| `.parac/roadmap/roadmap.yaml` | Roadmap |
| `.parac/GOVERNANCE.md` | Governance rules |
| `.parac/memory/logs/agent_actions.log` | Action logs |

## Workflow

1. Load context: `.parac/memory/context/current_state.yaml`
2. Select agent from `.parac/agents/specs/`:
   - `pm.md`, `architect.md`, `coder.md`, `tester.md`, `reviewer.md`, `documenter.md`
3. Read full agent spec
4. Apply agent standards
5. Execute task
6. Log using governance logger:

   ```python
   from paracle_core.governance import log_action, agent_context

   with agent_context("CoderAgent"):
       log_action("IMPLEMENTATION", "Added feature X")
   ```

7. Update `.parac/` as needed

## Action Types

- `IMPLEMENTATION` - New code
- `TEST` - Tests
- `BUGFIX` - Bug fixes
- `REFACTORING` - Code improvements
- `REVIEW` - Code review
- `DOCUMENTATION` - Docs
- `DECISION` - Architecture decisions

## DeepSeek Features

- Optimized for code generation and analysis
- Strong at understanding code context
- Use for complex refactoring tasks

## Code Standards

From `.parac/agents/specs/coder.md`:
- Python 3.10+, type hints required
- Pydantic for models
- pytest for testing
- Hexagonal architecture

## Dogfooding Context

```
packages/   ← Framework code (product)
.parac/     ← Project workspace (dogfooding)
```

## Rules

**DO:**
- Read `.parac/` before starting
- Log all significant actions
- Follow agent specs

**DON'T:**
- Duplicate agent definitions
- Ignore `.parac/` state
- Create custom governance rules

---

**Remember**: `.parac/` is your single source of truth. Always read it first.
