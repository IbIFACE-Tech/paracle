# Temporary Fix Scripts

This directory contains temporary Python scripts used during development and debugging.

## Scripts in this folder

These scripts were created during bug fixes and test development and have been moved here to keep the project root clean.

**⚠️ These scripts may be outdated or specific to past issues. Review carefully before using.**

Files:
- `add_*.py` - Scripts for adding methods/functionality during development
- `fix_*.py` - Bug fix scripts for various issues
- `cleanup.py` - Cleanup utilities
- `temp_test_fix.txt` - Temporary notes from test fixes

## Governance Rule

**Per `.parac/GOVERNANCE.md`**: All temporary scripts, reports, and non-root files MUST be placed in appropriate directories, never in project root.

- Scripts → `scripts/` or `scripts/temp/`
- Reports → `.parac/memory/summaries/`
- Tests → `tests/`
- Docs → `content/docs/`

## Cleanup

These files can be safely deleted once their purpose is no longer needed. They are kept temporarily for reference during active development.
