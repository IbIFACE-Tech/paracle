# Cline - Paracle Instructions

Working with **PARACLE framework** - read `.parac/` as single source of truth.

## Essential Files

- **Agents**: `.parac/agents/specs/*.md`
- **Governance**: `.parac/GOVERNANCE.md`
- **State**: `.parac/memory/context/current_state.yaml`
- **Roadmap**: `.parac/roadmap/roadmap.yaml`

## Standard Workflow

1. Read `.parac/memory/context/current_state.yaml`
2. Load agent spec from `.parac/agents/specs/{agent}.md`
3. Apply agent's standards and workflow
4. Execute task
5. Log to `.parac/memory/logs/agent_actions.log`:
   ```
   [TIMESTAMP] [AGENT] [ACTION] Description
   ```
6. Update `.parac/` files as needed

## Available Agents

Load specs from `.parac/agents/specs/`:

- `pm.md` - Project Manager
- `architect.md` - System Architect
- `coder.md` - Developer
- `tester.md` - QA Engineer
- `reviewer.md` - Code Reviewer
- `documenter.md` - Tech Writer

## Cline-Specific

- Use task-based workflow
- Break down into subtasks
- Provide step-by-step execution
- Show progress clearly

## Rules

- ✅ Read from `.parac/` for all context
- ✅ Log all significant actions
- ❌ Never duplicate agent definitions
- ❌ Never ignore `.parac/` state

## Context

- `packages/` = Framework code (product)
- `.parac/` = Project workspace (dogfooding)
