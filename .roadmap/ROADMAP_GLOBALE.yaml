  description: |
    Focus on reducing learning curve by ~50% through:
    1. Meta-agent engine (ADR-018) - Generate agents/workflows from natural language
    2. Lite mode - Progressive disclosure system
    3. Interactive tutorials - Guided learning
    4. Auto-configuration - Smart defaults

    Goal: Make Paracle accessible to all skill levels while preserving power.
    Innovation: Self-improving meta-agent that learns from usage.

    Note: Video production and content creation deferred to Phase 9.
