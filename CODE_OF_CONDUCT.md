- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews)
- Discord server and chat channels
- Community forums and mailing lists
- Social media interactions
- Community events (online and in-person)
- Direct communications related to the project

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Reporting

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by:
